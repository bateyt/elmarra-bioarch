During that time, the author collected osteological data on human skeletal remains recovered from the Early Bronze mortuary complex, as well as several other skeletal assemblages not associated with the Early Bronze period and/or recovered from localities outside of the site’s acropolis center. All skeletal remains analyzed in 2006 are curated on site, except a small collection of skeletal and dental remains, now curated by Glenn Schwartz, project co-director. Barbara Stuart provided initial field descriptions of the human remains, and other preliminary assessments were made by Bruno Frohlich and Judith Littleton of the Smithsonian Institution (Schwartz 2007). The goal was to re-analyze all human remains recovered from the tomb complex in order to investigate a number of topics, including demography, diet, health and paleopathology, possible familial relationships, and lifestyle reconstruction. 1.2 Methods All data were collected by the author according to protocols outlined in Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). The following report includes a summary of those observations and some results of recent analyses of the data. References "],

Remains from Tombs 1 and 4 exhibit the best overall preservation. Individuals with poor preservation were generally incomplete, highly fragmentary, or the bones had undergone significant taphonomic degradation. For each tomb, the minimum number of individuals (MNI) was determined by considering repeated skeletal elements and matching commingled remains based upon diagnostic indicators for age and sex, as well as general appearance. In some instances, especially if the remains were highly fragmentary, a large portion of the remains could not be assigned to any particular individual (e.g., Tombs 3 and 7). Human remains recovered from the tomb complex (up to the 2006 field season) represent an MNI of 35 individuals (see Table 1). 2.2 Paleopathology 2.2.1 General Observations Due to diff erential preservation, paleopathological data are not reported for nearly one-third of the sample. Also, because of time constraints, paleopathology was not recorded for the individuals from Tomb 8. Of those observed, 13/21 individuals exhibit some type of pathological lesion. The most common pathology is periostitis, which is commonly found in archaeological cemetery samples (Ortner 2003). Periostitis occurs in 6/21 of the observable sample and more frequently on the lower limbs, although the upper limbs are also aff ected. Both active and healed lesions were observed. Porotic hyperostosis, another lesion commonly reported in archaeological skeletal samples, is uncommon in the Umm el-Marra sample. Porotic hyperostosis is often considered a result of anemia, although its etiology is likely more complicated (Walker et al. 2009). No cases of porotic hyperostosis on the cranial vault occur; however, cribra orbitalia—porosities on the orbital roof—occur in 2/21 individuals. 2.2.2 Selected Cases 2.3 Dietary Reconstruction 2.3.1 Stable Isotope Analysis 2.3.2 Dental Wear 2.4 Dental Nonmetrics Dental nonmectric data were collected using the UADAS recording system (Scott and Turner 2000). Population distance was measured using Smith’s Mean Measure of Divergence, or MMD (Smith 1977). The MMD has become a well established method for anthropologists using nonmetric traints to investigate biological distance between populations (Harris and Sjøvold 2004). Soltysiak (2011) provides an R script for calculating the MMD.
